# My Rust Projects for self-learning

## Celestial Bodies
[PT-BR Version](https://github.com/Meneko/RustProjects/blob/main/README-PT.MD#corpos-celestiais)

This text is translated from portuguese to english!
This is a Rust project that I made to practice what I have learned up until the moment I wrote this text. This text will probably have grammatical errors, but in itself it
is about a manager of celestial bodies. I made it to be able to differentiate ```enum``` from ```struct```.
And that is why I made this project. Well, it already has the information about the celestial bodies (I used chat-gpt for the information and the bodies themselves, but I wrote
things manually) and also to be able to use ```impl```. 
In short, it is a """database""" about celestial bodies, almost the information that NASA has, so you can get information using the methods of a variable
that is of the ```CelestialBody``` type, such as showing the mass, radius, other information, etc.
